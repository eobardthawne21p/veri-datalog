# Verified Kernel in Dafny

## Purpose 

The purpose of this verified kernel is to encode a RuleSet corresponding to a set of Datalog rules and encode a set of facts( rules without bodies) in order to solve Datalog predicates. The major goal of this kernel is to one day encode a set of rules of criteria for verifiable X.509 web certificate fields and sets of facts corresponding to the fields' values in order to produce a theorem if the proof tree corresponding to these rules and facts is valid. 

## Data types of Kernel

### Const 

Const is the base type. The current Kernel implementation only deals with integers and strings. Future work will include support for lists.

### Subst

Type Subst is a hashmap of Consts.
Whenever the susbt function in used on any data type, high-order data types like Proof, Rule, etc. will call subst of the next-lower type in the hierarchy. Therefore, all items in Subst hashmaps are of type Const.

### Term

Terms are used as arguments in an Atom. They are used in the kernel to form Props which are the heads of Rules. When running mk_thm and performing substitutions, they will eventually be converted to Consts and the verifier will check for concreteness.

### Prop

Props are the heads of rules that are used in rulesets for mk_thm. They can also be 
In this datalog line of code: connected(a, b) :- edge(a, b). ---- connected(a, b) is a Prop in the head form. edge(a, b) is a Prop in the body form. Props are used as QED or termination in proofs. 

### Rule

Rules are the equivalent to rules in Datalog. A Rule in the kernel with no body is equivalent to a fact in Datalog. In this datalog line of code: connected(a, b) :- edge(a, b). ---- connected(a, b) :- edge(a, b) is a Rule that is also a rule in Datalog. In this datalog line of code: edge("x", "y"). ---- edge("x", "y"). is a Rule that is a fact in Datalog because it only has a head and no body.


### Ruleset

A RuleSet is a set of Rules in our kernel. 
RuleSets are composed of all rules in Datalogs programs that are run. They are related to valid() for Proof.
RuleSets are used to be passed to mk_thm along with the index into the RuleSet that you want it to be checked at for unification. 

### Proof

Proofs are used to construct theorems in our kernel.

### Thm
Theorems (thm) are used in our kernel as the final result that we are producing and want to check if they are valid or not. We check if they are valid by seeing if they are well formed.

## mk-leaf and mk_thm

mk_lf and mk_thm are called in the functions that you will write that will take take rulesets, Subst types, indexes of rules to apply, and arguments that will be used to determine if the proof tree is valid. In the toy example that will be shown, the ruleset is constructed manually by the programmer, and then the separate function testing the trace through the rules will produce a theorem if the trace is valid and return err if it is not. In the toy example and future toy examples used, it is useful to draw out the proof tree and then use mk_leaf to construct nodes of the tree that are terminal points. You can call mk_lf to call intermediate nodes and follow the trace until it's natural termination. Once the final thm has been produced, run Ok on that last thm.

## Verus specific features in implementation of kernel                  

One Verus specific feature in the implementation of the kernel is the separation between spec and exec code. Exec code is executable code such as functions susbt, mk_lf, and mk_thm that are commonly used in the kernel and are compileed. Spec code is code that reasons about the exec code without compiling and returns errors to the verifier if the code is not correct. Another is the use of loop invariants, triggers, assertions, and lemmas that were used to aid the verifier in reasoning about preconditions, postconditions, and recommendations. The ones left are essential for kernel verification, so do not remove them. They have been thoroughly commented and described in the code body.

Another verus specific feature used was deep_view which allowed us to access the deep_view of exec functions and call spec functions in exec mode when writing invariants, preconditions, poscondtions, and asserts. Additional ensures statements were used to help the verifier understand that the deep_view call could be before or after accessing fields of dat types and also reasoning that the exec versions and spec versions functioned the same way. 


TmpStringHashMap was another Verus specific feature in the implementation of the kernel. Developed by Jay Lorch, the StringHashMap data structure was introduced to the vstd library for Verus. Our team utilized addtional functions such as deep_view and partial_eq for StringHashMap, so the attached TmpStringHashMap file in the repository is the version that includes that functions that are used.

## Missing features

Some missing features from this verified kernel in Verus versus the original devleoped in Dafny are:
1. BuiltInOp support
2. #[verifier::external_body] used in some palces due to limitations in Verus (needs to be changed when support is added in Verus)

## Toy Example of kernel working

A toy example was ported from the original Dafny to verus. The first function that constructs the ruleset verifies, but there are currently failures proving preconditions for the second one that returns the result of the proof tree corresponding to the predicate that is trying to be achieved.

We used the following Datalog program and constructed a ruleset corresponding to its rules and facts. Then we made thms based on the proof tree that we manually drew and implemented in Verus.

```connected(a, b) :- edge(a, b).          " a and b are connected if there is an edge from a to b "
connected(a, c) :- connected(a, b), edge(b, c).         " a and c are connected if a and b are connected and there exists an edge from b to c "
edge("x", "y").      " there exists an edge between "x" and "y" "
edge("x", "f").      " there exists an edge between "x" and "f" "
edge("y", "z").      " there exists an edge between "y" and "z" "
edge("z", "w").      " there exists an edge between "z" and "w" "
```


The query is: ?- connected("x", "w").

The resulting veruscode for this datalog program is in fn tst_connected

## tst_connected

```
 pub fn tst_connected() -> (res: RuleSet)

}
```

## tst_connected_thm

This function will take the ruleset that we just created, an index into the rule it will try to use, a Subst type which corresponds to what we will insert at each node in the proof tree. In theory, if we were given proof tree from the trace reconstruction algorithm, we could just turn each step from trace output to theorems and run Ok on the final theorem, but for now we need to use mk_thm to generate each step.

```

pub fn tst_connected_thm() -> (res: Result<Thm, ()>) 
{
    // calls tst_connected to generate RuleSet
    let rs = tst_connected();

    // Corresponds to first step in proof tree where a is substituted for x and b is substituted for y
    let mut s1 = TmpStringHashMap::<Const>::new();
    s1.insert("a".to_string(), Const::Atom("x".to_string()));
    s1.insert("b".to_string(), Const::Atom("y".to_string()));
    let thm1 = mk_thm(&rs, 0, &s1, &vec![]);
  
    // Corresponds to first step in proof tree where a is substituted for x and c is substituted for y
    let mut s2 = TmpStringHashMap::<Const>::new();
    s2.insert("a".to_string(), Const::Atom("x".to_string()));
    s2.insert("c".to_string(), Const::Atom("y".to_string()));
    let thm2 = mk_thm(&rs, 1, &s2, &vec![]);

    // Corresponds to first step in proof tree where a is substituted for y and b is substituted for z
    let mut s3 = TmpStringHashMap::<Const>::new();
    s3.insert("a".to_string(), Const::Atom("y".to_string()));
    s3.insert("b".to_string(), Const::Atom("z".to_string()));
    let thm3 = mk_thm(&rs, 0, &s3, &vec![]);

    // Corresponds to first step in proof tree where a is substituted for x and c is substituted for w
    let mut s4 = TmpStringHashMap::<Const>::new();
    s4.insert("a".to_string(), Const::Atom("x".to_string()));
    s4.insert("c".to_string(), Const::Atom("z".to_string()));
    let thm4 = mk_thm(&rs, 1, &s4, &vec![]);

    // Corresponds to first step in proof tree where a is subsituted for z and b is subsituted for w
    let mut s5 = TmpStringHashMap::<Const>::new();
    s5.insert("a".to_string(), Const::Atom("z".to_string()));
    s5.insert("b".to_string(), Const::Atom("w".to_string()));
    let thm5 = mk_thm(&rs, 0, &s5, &vec![]);

    // Corresponds to first step in proof tree where a is subsituted for x and b is subsituted for w
    let mut s6 = TmpStringHashMap::<Const>::new();
    s6.insert("a".to_string(), Const::Atom("x".to_string()));
    s6.insert("c".to_string(), Const::Atom("w".to_string()));
    let thm6 = mk_thm(&rs, 1, &s6, &vec![]);

    //since we found that ("x", "w") are connected, it should return Ok(val)
    match thm6 {
        Ok(val) => Ok(val),
        Err(_) => Err(()),
    } 
}

```

If your proof tree is constructed correctly according to the ruleset that you provide, the verifier will verify the tests functions. Incorrect input will result in Err



## Future work

We still need to: 
1. Add support for builtinops 
2. Add support for List variant for Const type
2. Make ghost versions for proof 
3. Make examples meet all postcondtions and preconstions 
4. Port trace reconstruction from Dafny to Verus
5. Use future builtinops and trace reconstruction algorithm to run examples of X.509 certificates
