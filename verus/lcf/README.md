## Verified Kernel in Dafny

## Purpose 

## The purpose of this verified kernel is to take in a RuleSet corresponding to a set of Datalog rules and encode a set of facts( rules without bodies) in order to solve Datalog predicates. The major goal of this kernel is to one day encode a set of rules of criteria for verifiable X.509 web certificate fields and sets of facts corresponding to the fields' values in order to produce a theorem if the proof tree corresponding to these rules and facts is valid. 

## Data types of Kernel

## Missing features

## Toy Example of kernel working
